Duchenne experiment data accompanying the paper by Whitehill, et al., Whose Vote Should Count More: Optimal Integration of Labels from Labelers of Unknown Expertise", NIPS 2009:

    Click here for the Duchenne labels obtained from the Mechanical Turk workers. Format: each row contains three columns. The first column contains the image ID; the second column contains the labeler ID; the third column contains the label (0 = non-Duchenne, 1 = Duchenne).
    Click here for the "ground truth" Duchenne labels obtained from expert facial expression coders. Format: each row contains two columns. The first column contains the image ID; the second column contains the ground truth Duchenne label (0 or 1).
    Click here for a Matlab script to compute the accuracy of estimating the Duchenne labels using GLAD versus Majority Vote.
    The faces themselves are unfortunately not available as they are proprietary.

The data above were used to obtain the results presented in the NIPS 2009 paper. The data can be used for academic purposes; please cite the paper mentioned above.

In addition, we have since improved upon the GLAD algorithm presented in the NIPS 2009 paper: for better results on the Duchenne data, please see Ruvolo, et al., Exploiting Structure in Crowdsourcing Tasks via Latent Factor Models, MPLab Tech Report 2010.
